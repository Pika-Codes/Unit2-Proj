                    Rising average temperatures do not simply mean balmier winters. Some regions will experience more extreme 
                    heat while others may cool slightly. Flooding, drought and intense summer heat could result. Violent storms
                    and other extreme weather events could also result from the increased energy stored in our warming 
                    atmosphere.
                    One of the most serious impacts of climate change is how it will affect water resources around the world. 
                    Water is intimately tied to other resource and social issues such as food supply, health, industry, 
                    transportation and ecosystem integrity.
                    Climate change also threatens the health of our children and grandchildren through increased disease, 
                    freshwater shortages, worsened smog and more. These impacts also pose incalculable economic risks that far
                    outweigh the economic risks of taking action today.
                    The world’s leading scientists report that to prevent dangerous levels of global warming governments should
                    act to limit global warming to less than 2ºC by taking concerted action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
                    The sooner we act to reduce greenhouse gases, the less severe impacts will be. Now is the time to 
                    implement solutions.

                    Here are some tips to help reduce your impact on climate change.
                    Consider making some or all of these small changes. Together, they can really add up.
                    A house with a furnace is like a car that idles all day. Swap your furnace for a heat pump, which works 
                    by extracting heat from one location and transferring it to another
                    Install a programmable thermostat
                    Swap your gas stove for an electric stove, which will also lower indoor air pollution
                    Unplug computers, TVs and other electronics when you’re not using them
                    Wash clothes in cold water. Hang-dry your clothes when you can and use  dryer balls  when you can’t
                    Look for the Energy Star label when buying new appliances
                    Winterize your home to prevent heat from escaping and try to keep it cool in the summer without an air 
                    conditioner
                    Change to energy-efficient light bulbs
                    Get a home or workplace energy audit to identify where you can make the most energy-saving gains
                    Eat more meat-free meals
                    Buy organic and local whenever possible
                    Don’t waste food
                    Grow your own
                    And, Most importantly,
                    Solving climate change requires us all to work together. We can’t do that without finding common ground 
                    with those who may not share our perspective.
                    Since people often trust peers, family members and loved ones more than they trust experts, 
                    scientists and environmental organizations, you can talk to people about climate change in ways we can’t. 
                    You are more likely to open people’s minds.
                    If you do theese things, you will not only reduce your impact, you will also create enough talk for 
                    the talk to spread, and maybe it will get into the ears of the government.

                    My propsed solution is to convince you to raise discussions about this issue. 
                    Eventually, enough talk will happen, the parties will need to listen to us to get seats in the parliment.
                    Then, my proposed course of action for the government is to give rebates on people instaalling solar panels
                    or tiles on their roofs. This will encourage people to do it, and the power grid will have less of a strain 
                    on it, leaving more room for the power plants to be replaced with sustainable sources of energy.
