            <h1>Why Is Climate Change A Problem?</h1>
            <p>
                Climate change is a problem because of the long lasting impacts it causes. The impacts of climate chage are 
                immense and will need to be redued as much as possible. I will go over the problems on the information page, 
                but there are a few major reasons steps haven't been takes to reduce the impact of climate change. This is because
                there isn't enough governmental support for sustainable power production and increased energy efficiency. 
                This means that sustainable energy is getting nowhere in becoming the main source of energy in all individual 
                countries, which is a crucial step towards fully sustainable energy production. 
                Without fully sustainable energy production, we won't be able to protect this planet from burning up, 
                as evident in the recent Australia situation. There aren't many solutions for this problem for 3 reasons. 
                The first is the technology for power production and transportation isn't where it needs to be for mass 
                sustainable power generation, specifically solar. The second reason is cost. It will cost a lot of money to 
                set up the system, and governments aren't willing to spend money on things that don't appease big companies 
                like oil ones. The final reason is the government itself. The budget is a problem, but to do this, it will need 
                to pass through ALL stages of government. Some people are unwilling for the possibility of either budget cuts 
                or cuts to their own pay, and there are others who are in cahoots with oil companies or people who don't believe 
                climate change os a problem. For this reason, it is a possibility that the proposal will be denied.
